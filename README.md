# 🌐 Sigma Web Dev Course

Welcome to my 📁 **Sigma Web Dev Course** repository!

This repo contains all the practice projects, mini assignments, and notes from the **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** course I completed on YouTube. It's a comprehensive learning journey that helped me master the fundamentals of front-end web development. 💻

## 🧠 What I Learned

- ✅ **HTML5** – Semantic structure, forms, media, tables, and accessibility.
- ✅ **CSS3** – Selectors, Flexbox, Grid, animations, responsive design.
- ✅ **JavaScript** – DOM manipulation, events, functions, loops, arrays, objects, and basic projects.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- VS Code 💻  
- Live Server 🔄  
- Google Chrome DevTools 🌐

## 🎯 Goal

This repo reflects my step-by-step progress and growth while following the course. It serves as both a portfolio of my practice and a personal reference for future web projects.

## 🚀 What's Next?

I'm currently expanding my skills by diving into:
- ⚛️ React.js  
- 🧑‍💻 Full Stack Development (MERN)  
- 🌱 Open-source contributions
